/**
 * Runs backup on a preset interval
 * <br><br>
 * The important thing to note: <br>
 * The decision of whether to do a backup or not is made at the time of scheduling, that is, whenever the <code>nextBackup</code>
 * flag is set. This means that even if doBackupsOnEmptyServer=false, the backup that was scheduled with players online will
 * still go through. <br>
 * It might appear as though there has been made a backup with no players online despite the config. This is the expected behaviour
 * <br><br>
 * Furthermore, it uses system time
